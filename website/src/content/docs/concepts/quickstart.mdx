## Installation

Bunshi is distributed on NPM as both a CommonJS and ES Module. It supports both JavaScript and TypeScript,
and since it's written in TypeScript it comes with type definitions and tests for typing out of the box.

```sh
npm i -D bunshi
```

## Create a Molecule

**Molecules** are the core of bunshi. They are functions that return a value. Use molecules to create something
to share across your app. For this example, a `jotai` atom.

```ts
import { molecule } from "bunshi";
import { atom } from "jotai/vanilla";

export const CountMolecule = molecule(() => atom(0));
```

> When this `CountMolecule` is used it will always return the same `atom`. The value is memoized and cached
> so that it can be shared across an app.

## Use a Molecule

To use a molecule, pass it to `useMolecule` in your framework integration (React or Vue). An instance of `atom` will be automatically created once 
and shared across the application in every call to `useMolecule`.

## Scope a Molecule

Molecules can be [scoped](/concepts/scopes). Scoped molecules provide one value per scope, instead of one value globally.
In the above example the `atom` was shared globally across the app, now let's give each component it's own state
using the built-in `ComponentScope`.

```ts
import { ComponentScope, molecule, use } from "bunshi";
import { atom } from "jotai/vanilla";

export const CountMolecule = molecule(() => {
  // Because scope is used here, this molecule is component scoped
  use(ComponentScope);
  return atom(0);
});
```

Scoping is declarative. By calling `use(ComponentScope)` the molecule will automatically be scoped.

        "src/molecules.ts": quickstart.molecules2,

      dependencies={{
        jotai: "^2.5",
        "jotai-vue": "^0.1",
      }}
      template="vite-vue"
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

> Important: See how the source for `Counter` didn't change? This shows how Bunshi lets you pull state up, or
> push state down. No component changes needed, only molecule changes.

## Use a custom scope

Sometimes state doesn't need to be shared globally or per-component, but somewhere in the middle like a Form. Bunshi has `createScope` for this.
There are many use cases for [scopes](/concepts/scopes); sharing data across pages, sections, forms, or even rows or columns in a table.

Here let's share our state for all counters in the same form.

```ts
import { createScope, molecule, use } from "bunshi";
import { atom } from "jotai/vanilla";

// FormScope will be used for provided a string value to forms
export const FormScope = createScope("none");

export const CountMolecule = molecule(() => {
  // Since scope is used here, it makes `CountMolecule` scoped to the form
  use(FormScope);
  return atom(0);
});
```

## Provide a custom scope

Custom scopes need to be provided using the framework-specific API. Bunshi comes with integrations into React and Vue to provide scope implicitly.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="React">
    For React use a `ScopeProvider` as a wrapping component, and all children
    can implicitly use that scope.
    <CodeEditor
      files={{
        "App.tsx": quickstart.ReactFormApp,
        "molecules.ts": quickstart.molecules3,
      }}
      dependencies={{
        jotai: "^2.5",
      }}
    />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Vue">
    For Vue use `provideScope` to provide scope implicitly to all children in
    the `slot`.
    <CodeEditor
      files={{
        "src/App.vue": quickstart.VueFormApp,
        "src/Counter.vue": quickstart.VueCounter,
        "src/Form.vue": quickstart.VueForm,
        "src/molecules.ts": quickstart.molecules3,
      }}
      dependencies={{
        jotai: "^2.5",
        "jotai-vue": "^0.1",
      }}
      template="vite-vue"
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

In this example everything inside of the `<Form>` component will share an `atom`, it won't be unique per component
or shared across the entire application.

## Conclusion - Decoupled and Lazy

The code that you wrote is decoupled and lazy.

- **Decoupled**: You can refactor the `CountMolecule` without affecting the thing that depend on it.
- **Lazy**: An atom is only created lazily when it's needed. It's not eagerly created and sitting around in a global variable.

When your write code with molecules, you can pull state up or push state down, without having to refactor your components.

There are many other powerful features for molecules in Bunshi, such as:

- Molecules using other molecules
- Molecules using lifecycles to run code when they are first used (i.e. mounted or unmounted)
- Molecule interfaces for decoupling molecules
- Straightforward usage with many different state libraries
